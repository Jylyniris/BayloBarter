# BayloBarter
BayloBarter is a platform where students may exchange items with one another. It is a safe and secure transaction platform that promotes a community of people that are passionate about sustainability and waste reduction.

Main Goals
●Platform where students want to give for free, an unwanted item.
●A platform where the free item can be taken by another person that needs it.
●A very simple and user-friendly platform where exchange happens effectively and that does not turn away people.
